### Abstract
This HIP proposes an enhancement (with backwards compatibility) to the Hedera REST API to include decimal information in the token balance queries. Currently, users face challenges in accurately determining token balances due to the absence of decimal details in the `/tokens`, `/api/v1/tokens/{tokenId}/balances`, and `/account/{idOrAliasOrEvmAddress}/tokens` endpoints. This proposal aims to reduce the number of API calls needed and streamline the process of retrieving comprehensive token information.

### Motivation
This HIP, aligned with [HIP-367](hip-367.md)'s initiative to deprecate HAPI queries, seeks to ensure that mirror node APIs offer comparable functionality. Retrieving token balance information without decimal details currently necessitates multiple API calls, leading to inefficiencies and a heightened computational load. By integrating decimal details into balance queries, this proposal aims to streamline the process, significantly reducing the time, cost, and complexity involved, crucial for accurate token balance determination.

### Specification
The proposed solution involves modifying the response structure of three endpoints:

**Route:**  
`/api/v1/tokens`

**Current Response Structure:**
```json
{
  "tokens": [
    {
      "admin_key": null,
      "symbol": "PEC_E",
      "token_id": "0.0.732556",
      "type": "NON_FUNGIBLE_UNIQUE"
    }
  ],
  "links": {
    "next": null
  }
}
```

**Proposed Response Structure:**
```json
{
  "tokens": [
    {
      "admin_key": null,
      "symbol": "PEC_E",
      "name": "[Token Name]",
      "token_id": "0.0.732556",
      "type": "NON_FUNGIBLE_UNIQUE",
      "decimals": 3
    }
  ],
  "links": {
    "next": null
  }
}
```

**Route:**  
`/api/v1/tokens/{tokenId}/balances`

**Current Response Structure:**
```json
{
  "timestamp": "1586567700.453054000",
  "balances": [
    {
      "account": "0.15.2",
      "balance": 1000
    }
  ],
  "links": {
    "next": null
  }
}
```

**Proposed Response Structure:**
```json
{
  "timestamp": "1586567700.453054000",
  "balances": [
    {
      "account": "0.15.2",
      "balance": 1000,
      "decimals": 3
    }
  ],
  "links": {
    "next": null
  }
}
```

**Route:**  
`/api/v1/accounts/{idOrAliasOrEvmAddress}/tokens`

**Current Response Structure:**
```json
{
  "tokens": [
    {
      "automatic_association": true,
      "balance": 0,
      "created_timestamp": "123456789.000000001",
      "freeze_status": "UNFROZEN",
      "kyc_status": "GRANTED",
      "token_id": "0.0.732556"
    },
    {
      "automatic_association": true,
      "balance": 66625030355247581,
      "created_timestamp": "123456789.000000001",
      "freeze_status": "UNFROZEN",
      "kyc_status": "GRANTED",
      "token_id": "0.0.868062"
    }
  ],
  "links": {
    "next": null
  }
}
```

**Proposed Response Structure:**
```json
{
  "tokens": [
    {
      "automatic_association": true,
      "balance": 0,
      "created_timestamp": "123456789.000000001",
      "freeze_status": "UNFROZEN",
      "kyc_status": "GRANTED",
      "token_id": "0.0.732556",
      "decimals": 3
    },
    {
      "automatic_association": true,
      "balance": 66625030355247581,
      "created_timestamp": "123456789.000000001",
      "freeze_status": "UNFROZEN",
      "kyc_status": "GRANTED",
      "token_id": "0.0.868062",
      "decimals": 3
    }
  ],
  "links": {
    "next": null
  }
}
```

The addition of the `decimals` field will provide the necessary information to accurately determine token balances without requiring additional API calls.

### Rationale
The inclusion of decimal information in token balance queries significantly reduces the number of API calls needed to accurately determine account balances. Fewer API calls should reduce the overhead costs they produce. This enhancement aligns with the principles of efficiency, scalability, and user-friendliness that are central to the design of the Hedera API. By simplifying the process of balance retrieval, this proposal aims to improve the developer experience and the performance of applications built on Hedera.

### Backwards Compatibility
This change is backwards compatible as it introduces additional fields in the API response structure without altering the existing fields or the overall behavior of the endpoints. Clients not requiring decimal information can ignore the new fields, ensuring uninterrupted service for applications built on the current API version.

### Security Implications
This proposal does not introduce changes that affect the security posture of the Hedera API. The addition of the `decimals` field is a non-interactive change that does not alter the API's authentication, authorization, or data integrity mechanisms. The proposed change rather increases the scalability by making access to working functions easier for new developers.

## How to Teach This
To teach the updates introduced in HIP 873 for the Hedera Network, focus on highlighting the key enhancement: the integration of decimal information in token balance API calls. Begin by contextualizing the problem - developers previously needed multiple calls to accurately fetch token balances and decimals, a process that was inefficient and computationally intensive. Then, introduce the solution provided by HIP 873, where the API's response structure is enriched to include a decimals field in the `/tokens`, `/tokens/{tokenId}/balances`, and `/accounts/{idOrAliasOrEvmAddress}/tokens` endpoints. Emphasize the benefits of this change, such as the reduction in the number of API calls and the streamlined process for determining accurate token balances, making the system more efficient and developer-friendly. 

## Reference Implementation

## Rejected Ideas
During the ideation phase of improving the Hedera REST API, several ideas were considered but ultimately rejected in favor of the current implementation in HIP 873. The main focus was on adding more information to the routes for mutable token-level variables. However, these ideas were discarded due to concerns about scalability and potential performance impacts.

## Open Issues
